## What is Python and what is it used for?

[Python](https://docs.python.org/3.8/) is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that works on many platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows, Raspberry Pi, etc). It's easy to learn and can pretty much be used for anything, some examples are:

- Web development
- Videogame development
- AI & Machine Learning
- Data analytics

## Python in a nutshell

Everything in Python is an *object* of an specific type or class. Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods. Objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

Objects are assigned to *variables*. A variable is a symbolic name that is a reference (or pointer) to an object, but the data itself is still contained within the object.

## How to start?

There are two ways in which you could take this course:

### Using Google Colab (recommended)

I strongly recommend using Google Colab to be able to play and code throughout the course without having to setup anything in your computer. This way, you will be able to run all the notebooks yourself and do the exercises directly in the notebook as well. For this option, follow the links above under "Course's content".

### Locally

If you wish to run the Jupyter notebooks in your laptop/computer, please follow the instructions below to install Python, Jupyter, and download the content of the course.

#### How to install Python (Linux, Windows, macOS)?
