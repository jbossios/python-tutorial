[Python](https://docs.python.org/3.8/) is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that works on many platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows, Raspberry Pi, etc). It's easy to learn and can pretty much be used for anything, some examples are:

- Web development
- Videogame development
- AI & Machine Learning
- Data analytics

Everything in Python is an *object* of an specific type or class. Objects contain data in the form of attributes and code in the form of methods. Objects are instances of classes, which also determine their types.

Objects are assigned to *variables*. A variable is a symbolic name that is a reference (or pointer) to an object, but the data itself is still contained within the object.

<u>**This tutorial is divided into four notebooks (which can be found in the 'Jupyter-Notebooks/' folder) targeting different aspects:**</u>

1. Introduction to Python for data analysis: Basics
2. Introduction to Python for data analysis: Functions
3. Introduction to Python for data analysis: Object-oriented programming
4. Introduction to Python for data analysis: Helpful tips and modules

For those which wish to learn more about Python, there is an extension of this tutorial that is composed of different Python modules targetting aspects not covered on the main course (which can be found in the 'Python-tutorial-extension/' folder).
